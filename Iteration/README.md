This folder contains the Mathematica files to perform the late-order expansion to obtain the variable K_2. Specifically, each folder has just one file that needs to be run cell by cell in order to obtain an approximation of the coefficient $c_r^{[0]}$ explained in the article arXiv preprint arXiv:2501.02698 (Equation (46)).

To run the code, you have to set up the system in Mathematica on the second cell, by following any of the examples. You need to run the Python code before any of these scripts because the values of $\xi$, $\eta$, $A_1$, and $A_3$ are needed to run these files.

After setting the system up and choosing the maximum order you would like to expand your equation up to, you can just run the code and then plot the result.
